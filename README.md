Hello, I'm [Hussein Trilli]

I'm passionate about programming and problem-solving. Currently learning C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and enhancing my problem-solving skills using Visual Studio.
I'm following the Abu-Hadhoud Roadmap and enjoy building projects, improving my skills, and sharing my progress with the community.
